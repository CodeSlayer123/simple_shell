# Simple Shell Interpreter

## Welcome!
#### This repository is a recreation of Unix's shell. It functions just like the shell, in which you can run commands, files, and even use the exit function or CTRL+D to exit.

## Here is a guide to using the simple shell (hsh):
#### To run the program, ensure you are in the simple_shell repository, and then run
> gcc *.c -o hsh
#### and then
> ./hsh
#### Now you are in the shell! Simply type such commands as:
> ls
> 
> pwd
> 
> exit
#### Or, any other common commands found in your $PATH. Happy simulating!
